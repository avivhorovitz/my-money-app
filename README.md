in this app you can keep track of all your expenses in one place.

this app uses React in the fronend and Google's Firebase as a backend service(Auth,DB and hosting)

all of the components are fucntional components.

iv'e used React hooks(useRef,useReducer,useState,useContext) and some sevral custom hooks that are easy to maintain an re-use

enjoy :)
